BigInt-Arithmetic is a powerful C++ library designed to handle arithmetic with large integers far beyond the limits of standard data types. This project provides efficient and accurate implementations of common operations on big integers, making it a valuable tool for applications that require high-precision calculations, including cryptographic algorithms, combinatorics, and mathematical computations with Catalan numbers.

Key Features:
(i) Big Integer Arithmetic: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of extremely large integers.
(ii) Catalan Number Calculation: Efficient calculation of Catalan numbers, which are widely used in combinatorial mathematics.
(iii) Overflow Handling: Safely computes values without overflow limitations of standard integer types.
(iv) Applications: Ideal for cryptography, combinatorial structures, and high-precision mathematical simulations.
